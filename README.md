# Important Notes
1. Follow setup.sh to properly setup the environment and install dependencies.
   "setup.sh"
2. Run run_exp.sh to get a result of classifier.py.
   "run_exp.sh"
3. If you want to get the classification report, use report.py with python.
   "python3 report.py"
   then,"classification_report.txt" will come out in the same rep.
